	  	<p></p>
	  	<p>In 1997 activist Tarana Burke heard the story of a 13 year old sexual abuse survivor, Tarana told the New York Times “I didn’t have a response or a way to help her in that moment, and I couldn’t even say ‘me too,’”. She began the #MeToo in 2006.</p>
	  	<p>On the 5th of October 2017 The New York Times published an article that accuses Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault that spans over three decades. Eleven days later actress Alyssa Milano encourages people to use the #MeToo to share their stories of sexual abuse and assault to show the extend of the problem. It becomes a global phenomenon over the next week.</p>
	  	<p>Over the next few months different actresses and media professionals would meet to create the #Timesup movement. These two anti-sexual harassment and women's empowerment movements changed the conversation across the entire world. Spawning hundreds of versions of the hashtags in different languages across the globe.</p>
